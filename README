BBQ : Cooking Data with Ruby
-----------------------------------

Let’s say your doing some embedded game development and your data is generated 
procedurally in Ruby. How do you get data from Ruby into a binary form, so that 
you can access it directly from a C structure?

With BBQ, that’s how.

Overview
-----------
BBQ is a set of tools that do the following:

 * Generates a c header file from a data description file.
 * Cooks data from a data instance file into a binary blob.
 * Loads in the binary blob into memory on the target machine, so you don’t have 
   to do any messy serialization work.

Data Definition
-----------------------
First you have to define your data in a .dd file.

Here’s an example called level.dd

BBQ.header do
  struct Child do
    uint32 cookie, 0xfeedf00d
    var_array int32, numbers
  end

  struct :Level do
    uint32 :cookie, 0xbaadf00d
    var_array Child, children
  end
end

Looks a lot like a C header file right? Well, that’s because it gets turned into 
one when you run the burn tool.

The values 0xfeedf00d & 0xbaadf00d are defaults. They can be overridden in the data 
instance file.

Generating Header Files with Burn
---------------------------------------------
To turn your .dd into a .h, run the burn tool.

bbq-burn level.dd level.h

Here’s an example of the generated header:

#ifndef LEVEL_H
#define LEVEL_H

struct Child {
    unsigned int cookie;
    int* numbers; unsigned int numbers_size;
};
struct Level {
    unsigned int cookie;
    Child* children; unsigned int children_size;
};

#endif

Now You’re Cooking with Ruby
Ok, now lets generate some binary data with Ruby.

Let’s create a file called level.di

load 'level.dd'

BBQ.data do
  Level.build(:children => [Child.build(:numbers => [1,2,3]),
                            Child.build(:numbers => [3,4]),
                            Child.build(:numbers => [5])])
end

This data file sets up a “level” with 3 children. The first child has numbers (1,2,3) 
the second (3,4) and the third a single number 5.

Notice that because we didn’t specify values for the cookie fields they will just use 
their defaults.

Now let’s cook this sucker:

bbq-cook level.di level.bin

Now you end up with a binary blob ready to be copied over to your target device.

Loading the Data on the Target
--------------------------------------
First, make sure you add bbq.cpp to your code’s project file. Then you can use the 
bbq_load() function to read in the binary file and give you back a pointer to the root 
of it so you can use it directly.

Here’s how:

#include "bbq.h"
#include "level.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    Level* level = (Level*)bbq_load("level.bin");

    printf("loaded level!\n");
	
    printf("level has %d children\n", level->children_size);

    for (unsigned int i = 0; i < level->children_size; ++i)
    {
        printf("    child %d has %d numbers\n", i, level->children[i].numbers_size);
        printf("        [ ");
        for (unsigned int j = 0; j < level->children[i].numbers_size; ++j)
            printf("%d ", level->children[i].numbers[j]);
	printf("]\n");
    }

    bbq_free(level);

    return 0;
}

Now when you run this guy you should get this in stdout.

loaded level!
level has 3 children
    child 0 has 3 numbers
        [ 1 2 3 ]
    child 1 has 2 numbers
        [ 3 4 ]
    child 2 has 1 numbers
        [ 5 ]
