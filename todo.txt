bbq - data cooking in ruby
----------------------------

(1.0) Goals
------
Define data definition files in a ruby dsl.
Ability to marshal data from ruby into a binary blob.
Ability to generate c++ code to unmarshal the binary blob into an in-memory structure.
Fast unmarshaling code on the c++ side.  Should just be a cast & pointer fixup.
Support for basic types: ints, floats.
Support for heirarchical types: structs & pointers.
* TODO: Cooker should also be able to generate human readable dump of cooked data, for debugging.

Example
--------
Level files for iphone game are defined in a .dd file.  Ruby DSL
Each levels data for iphone game is in a .di file.  Ruby DSL
bbq-cook can take a .di & a .dd and generate a binary blob (and an optional text file)
bbq-burn can take a .dd file and generate c++ code that can read in a cooked blob file.

level.dd + horsey-level.di  => bbq-cook  => binary blob
level.dd                    => bbq-burn  => c++ code


Futrue Goals
--------
* TODO: Cooker should also be able to generate human readable dump of cooked data, for debugging.
* TODO: Localization support.

* Handle header includes.  If a.dd loads b.dd, then the a.h should include b.h
* Dependencies
  * If a.dd changes, all .di's that load a.dd should be rebuilt.  Also, the headers should be rebuilt.
  * If a.dd includes b.dd and b.dd changes, all .di's that load a.dd should be rebuilt, Also, headers.
  * If a.di loads foo.rb, then if foo.rb changes. a.bin should be rebuilt.
  * if cube.di loads cube.dae then cube.bin should be rebuilt if cube.dae changes.

* Support C, (either thru macro wizardry or making bbq.c)
* di files are ugly.  Is there a cleaner way?
